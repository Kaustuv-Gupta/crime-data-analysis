Chicago crimedata analysis
Crime Analytics faces four major steps which are :-

1.	Evaluate criminal activity of Chicago city in U.S. by viewing dataset on crime data .Here we have considered from 2001 to present.

2.	Viewing and assessing the different types of crime occurred and plotting frequencies and crime rates of “Theft” each month from the year 2016 to present.

3.	Narrowing down our concern  on crime rate of “Theft” from the year 2016 to present over different police sectors or we say here as “Districts” and analysing it using Linear Regression Model.

4.	Predicting and analysing crime rate of unknown dataset or District and finding the Mean Squared Error in our prediction from the prediction model.
